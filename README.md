React tutorial project that yielded a fully interactive React app.
Key concepts: state hook, effect hook, API call, React components, and props.

Create your very own meme from a massive library of popular meme images!
Customize the top and bottom text.

This app performs an API call to a meme image library, then stores that library and allows the user to choose a random image from the library.
The user can add their own top and bottom text to the meme.
